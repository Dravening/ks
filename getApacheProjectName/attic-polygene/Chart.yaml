# A chart can be either an 'application' or a 'library' chart.

# Application charts are a collection of templates that can be packaged into versioned archives
# to be deployed.

# Versions are expected to follow Semantic Versioning (https://semver.org/)

# follow Semantic Versioning. They should reflect the version the application is using.
# It is recommended to use it with quotes.
