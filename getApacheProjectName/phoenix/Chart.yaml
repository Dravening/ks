description: Apache Phoenix enables OLTP and operational analytics for Apache Hadoop by providing a relational database layer leveraging Apache HBase as its backing store. It includes integration with Apache Spark, Pig, Flume, Map Reduce, and other products in the Hadoop ecosystem. It is accessed as a JDBC driver and enables querying, updating, and managing HBase tables through standard SQL.

# A chart can be either an 'application' or a 'library' chart.
#
# Application charts are a collection of templates that can be packaged into versioned archives
# to be deployed.
#
# Library charts provide useful utilities or functions for the chart developer. They're included as
# a dependency of application charts to inject those utilities and functions into the rendering
# pipeline. Library charts do not define any templates and therefore cannot be deployed.
type: application

# This is the chart version. This version number should be incremented each time you make changes
# to the chart and its templates, including the app version.
# Versions are expected to follow Semantic Versioning (https://semver.org/)
version: 0.1.0

# This is the version number of the application being deployed. This version number should be
# incremented each time you make changes to the application. Versions are not expected to
# follow Semantic Versioning. They should reflect the version the application is using.
# It is recommended to use it with quotes.
appVersion: "1.16.0"
